ARMA 3 Compass Plugin

This is part of my ARMA 3 desktop compass project. This is the game plugin, it periodically sends out compass direction via Socket for the Compass Server to receive.

This project consists of two parts
-The game mod
-A DLL

Check this tutorial to build the game mod

The dll is provided as VS2015 project. The dll needs to be put in the mods root folder (something like {arma root}/@compassClient/)
